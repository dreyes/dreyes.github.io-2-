      <main class="my-story">
        <p class="body-medium body-justify">I pride myself in being a resourceful and creative problem-solver with a curious mindset. I am driven by a mission to <strong class="body-large">make the world a better place</strong> than I found it.</p>
        <p class="body-medium body-justify">As a child, I wanted to be many things: <em>an astronaut, an architect, a robot maker</em>…the list goes on. Each role had its own differences, but one thing was similar about all - they all had a pinch of <strong>engineering</strong>.</p>
        <p class="body-medium body-justify">My curiosity for engineering and love for technology led me to study Mechatronics Engineering. Later in my studies, I discovered an excitement for programming and electronics and fell in love with the Maker Movement. This is when it finally hit me.</p> 
        <blockquote>My true passion...creating things.</blockquote>
        <p class="body-medium body-justify">My experience spans in <strong>entrepreneurship</strong>, <strong>customer-facing roles</strong>, <strong>diverse industries and a technical background</strong> <em>(I programmed this website from scratch!)</em>. Each of which equip me with the skills to adapt and approach challenges from different perspectives. My business acumen and exceptional interpersonal skills also define my professional execution.</p>
        <p class="body-medium body-justify">With 5+ years of service in a distributed workforce leading software projects, I also found advocacy for the <strong>remote work movement</strong>. This experience also granted me a "self starter" and "can do" attitude. <em>(And allows me to be anywhere I want!)</em></p>
        <p class="body-medium body-justify">I also enjoy the opportunity to foster professional growth in others through leadership. My style - leading with trust and empathy while seeking excellence through empowerment and accountability.</p>
        <p class="body-medium body-justify">I’m an avid learner, so outside of work you’ll find me learning something new in YouTube or in online courses, improving my italian, working on a “weekend project” or practicing a new magic trick. You might find me playing soccer too!</p>
        <p class="body-medium body-justify">If you'd like to talk about creating things together, hit me up! Looking forward to talking to you soon.</p>
